# Lens-Rigidity
Materials for the Lens Rigidity inverse problem

Hopefully, I can have both Matlab and Julia files in the long run. 
(Plan for later on: Primarily using Julia, but perhaps then rewriting them 
in Matlab - which would be secondary).

First: Ray tracing for a square domain, Gaussian metric. Also, a circular domain. 
Second: Tracing for any general polar curve and any metric of choice - See SmoothRayTracing.jl
